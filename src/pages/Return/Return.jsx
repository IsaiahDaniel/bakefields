        <div>
          <p>
            Due to the tedious, handcrafted nature of our products, we are
            unable to provide refunds or exchanges for custom orders Once you or
            a designated party has picked up an order and signed for it, it is
            considered "accepted" - we will ask to make sure that everything is
            correct such as the design, spelling, etc. Refunds requested due to
            decorating style, writing, color shade, or general design will not
            be honored after signing for your cake.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In some instances, you may bring the cake back in for design
            adjustments but this is an additional charge if the cake has been
            signed for All products are the responsibility of the customer once
            it leaves our shop. We are not responsible for any damage occurring
            to the cake during transport, set-up or any time thereafter. You
            will be given instructions on how to carry, transport, and store
            your cake upon pick up. Keep in mind that cakes are very fragile and
            damages can happen if not handled properly – such as cracks,
            smudges, melted frosting, etc.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We only give refunds in accordance with refund policies stated
            below: Cake flavor and texture is subjective. Full refunds requested
            due to flavor or texture after the cake has been accepted and picked
            up will not be honored. You may qualify for a percentage of a store
            credit if the product is brought back and the quality of the cake
            flavor or texture is determined to not meet our standards. Cakes
            must be brought back to us within a timely manner, preferably with 6
            hours of pick up - please call or email us promptly to let us know
            of the issue. Quality determination is solely at the discretion of
            Midbite cakes and confectionaries. Please understand that we cannot
            issue refunds for cakes that have already been completely eaten.
            Store credit percent are based on how quickly the cake is returned,
            and what we determine the return Value to be. Store credits of any
            kind will not be issued to customers who do not contact us within 6
            hours. If you come to our store for pick up or if upon delivery the
            cake does not meet your expectations, we will give you a refund
            (minus 25% handling/cancellation fee). This refund will be given as
            a store credit (no cash/money refunds will be given)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            NOTE: If we give you a refund, you CANNOT keep the cake. You can
            only get the refund if you refuse to “accept” the cake. We will NOT
            negotiate a partial refund if you keep the cake. This is a “take it,
            or leave it” policy. We are not responsible for any expense you may
            incur for replacing our cake We do not give refunds under any other
            circumstances. Refunds are only given within 14 days.

        <h2 className="text-4xl mb-6 mt-6">Cancellation / Changes</h2>
        <p>
          Changes and cancellations to retail orders are accepted until 168
          hours (7 days) prior to scheduled pick up time. No refunds will be
          provided for any payments made on the order no matter the amount - if
          canceled at least 168 hours in advance we will be happy to transfer
          any payment made on that order to another order within 3 months from
          that date. We will provide no other refunds regardless the
          circumstances. 3D Cakes and pastries require at least one week's
          notice if changes want to be made to the order, to change the date, or
          to cancel. You will be required to pay the full amount if the order is
          cancelled with less notice. This does not apply to orders that have
          contracts

          We do all that we can to make sure that your order is decorated to the
          specification on your written order form. Upon pick-up of your cake,
          adjustments can be made for an additional charge if it was not stated
          on your original order. If for some reason something is not decorated
          correctly as stated on your order, we will make necessary changes
          right away Every order is hand-made. Decorative finishes are done by
          hand and are subject to the artistic interpretation of our expert cake
          decorators. You may provide us with a photograph for inspiration and
          duplication; however, we make no claims for exact duplication of the
          work done by other cake decorators All orders are subject to these
          policies listed above.
